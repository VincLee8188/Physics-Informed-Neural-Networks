# Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks
I tried to construct the Pytorch-version implementation of the physics informed neural networks and successfully reproduced the numerical results in [Physics Informed Deep Learning (Part I): Data-driven Solutions of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10561).

The author's original implementation in Tensorflow
